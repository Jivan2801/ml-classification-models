## üìÅ Files Included
- `ml-classification-models.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with code and outputs
- `lab02_dataset_1.csv`: 3D dataset for Perceptron learning
- `lab02_dataset_2.xlsx`: Vehicle classification dataset for Naive Bayes

## üìå Problem 1: Perceptron Learning (Manual Implementation)
- Implemented `my_perceptron()` to find linear separator using perceptron algorithm.
- Dataset: 3D binary classification (`Positive`, `Negative`).
- Terminated training once misclassification rate < 1%.
- Visualized the data points and decision boundary in 3D.

---

## üìå Problem 2: Naive Bayes Classification
- Used categorical features: `CAR_TYPE`, `OCCUPATION`, `EDUCATION`
- Encoded using `OrdinalEncoder`
- Trained `CategoricalNB` with various Laplace smoothing values.
- Identified best `alpha` = 100 with accuracy = 87.32%.
- Calculated predicted class probabilities and conditional probabilities `P(Xi | Yj)`.
- Visualized histogram of predicted class probabilities.
- Misclassification rate using custom threshold (0.6): 86.79%
- Evaluated predictions on custom test cases.

---

## üìå Problem 3: Logistic Regression
- Used 8 numeric features initially.
- Scaled using `StandardScaler`, followed by 80-20 train-test split.
- Accuracy with numeric features: 82.44%
- Identified most important features by coefficient magnitude:
  - `loan_percent_income`
  - `loan_int_rate`
  - `loan_amnt`
- Added 3 top categorical features with highest correlation to target:
  - `previous_loan_defaults_on_file`
  - `loan_percent_income`
  - `loan_int_rate`
- Final model accuracy improved to: **82.69%**
